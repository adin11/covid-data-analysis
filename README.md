# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python & Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the global **COVID-19 pandemic** using real-world data. The analysis focuses on understanding the spread, impact, and trends of COVID-19 across countries and over time. Python's data science libraries were used in **Jupyter Notebook** to clean, explore, visualize, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

The goal is to uncover patterns in infection rates, death counts, recovery trends, and country-wise comparisons to support awareness and public health research.
